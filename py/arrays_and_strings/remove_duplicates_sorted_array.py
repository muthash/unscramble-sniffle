"""
Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each
element appear only once and return the new length.

Solution:
    - Use two pointers
    - Since the array is already sorted, we can keep two pointers i and j,
      where i is the slow-runner while j is the fast-runner.
    - As long as nums[i] = nums[j], we increment j to skip the duplicate.

    - When we encounter nums[j]â‰ nums[i],
        - The duplicate run has ended so we must copy its value to nums[i+1].
        - i is then incremented and we repeat the same process again until j reaches the end of array.

Clarification:
    - Note that the input array is passed in by reference,
      which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.
