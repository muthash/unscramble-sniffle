"""
Given two strings s1 and s2, write a function to return true if s2 contains the permutation of s1. 
In other words, one of the first string's permutations is the substring of the second string.

Solution(1):
  - Sliding Window Approach
    - We create a hashmap once for the first window in s2. 
    - Then, later on when we slide the window, we know that we add one preceding character and add a new succeeding character to the new window considered. 
    - Thus, we update the hashmap by just updating the indices associated with those two characters only. 
    - For every updated hashmap, we compare all the elements of the hashmap for equality to get the required result.

Solution(2):
  - Optimized Sliding Window Approach
    - Instead of comparing all the elements of the hashmaps for every updated s2map corresponding to every window of s2 considered, 
      we keep a track of the number of elements which were already matching in the earlier hashmap and 
      update just the count of matching elements when we shift the window towards the right.
    - To do so, we maintain a count variable, which stores the number of characters(out of the 26 alphabets),
      which have the same frequency of occurence in s1 and the current window in s2.
    - When we slide the window,
      - If the deduction of the last element and the addition of the new element leads to a new frequency match of any of the characters,
        we increment the count by 1. If not, we keep the count intact.
      - If a character whose frequency was the same earlier(prior to addition and removal) is added,
        it now leads to a frequency mismatch which is taken into account by decrementing the same count variable.
      - If, after the shifting of the window, the count evaluates to 26, it means all the characters match in frequency totally. 
        So, we return a True in that case immediately.
  - Time complexity : O(l1+(l2âˆ’l1)). where l1 is the length of string s1 and l2 is the length of string s2.
